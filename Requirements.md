Hello William,

 

My name is Tyler and I’m the CIO here at Quikaid.  I received your application on Indeed.com.  I’m emailing you today to request that you complete a programming test to gauge your real-world skills with the same technologies we use in our organization.  Assuming you pass this test, we will move on to an in-person interview at our office in downtown St Petersburg.

Please complete your test project using the following rules:

 - Use Visual Studio. (Not Visual Studio Code.) 
 - Use ASP.NET Core 3.1.
 - Host your project in a repository on GitHub.
	- When you’re ready for testing, add me to the repository at his email address.
 - The interface should be made using Razor Pages.
 - Create a database to store your data.
   - Use Entity Framework Core to interact with the database.
   - Your database should be code-first. 
   - Your database should use SQL Server via LocalDB and the MDF file placed inside your repository so that I can simply clone and run the application. 
 - Include a basic forms-based login system.
 - The application should be able to create, update, and delete Clients.
   - Clients should have at least the following properties:
      -  First name
      -  Last name
      -  Social Security Number
      -  Date of Birth
      -  Mailing address
 - You should be able to create, update, and delete Phone Numbers.
   - Phone Numbers should be associated to Clients as foreign keys.
 - Add a report to show all the Clients a given User created in a given date range.  Show how many Phone Numbers each Client has in this report.
 - Good programming practices are a big deal.
